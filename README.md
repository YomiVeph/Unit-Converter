Technologies Used

HTML5 & CSS3 – Structure and styling, including responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6) – Dynamic logic for live unit conversion and interactive features.

Google Fonts (Poppins) – Clean and modern typography.

Optional Enhancements: Choices.js or Tom Select for searchable, advanced dropdowns.

Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YomiVeph/Unit-converter.git


Navigate to the project folder:

cd Unit-converter


Open index.html in your preferred browser.

Usage:

Select the Unit Type (Length, Weight, Volume, Temperature).

Enter the amount you want to convert.

Choose the From and To units.

View the converted result instantly.

Use the swap button (↔) to switch units if needed.

How It Works

The app stores conversion factors for each unit type in JavaScript objects.

When a user enters a value or selects units, the app calculates the conversion based on a base unit.

For temperature, the app uses the correct formula conversions (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin).

Results are displayed instantly, updating live without page reloads.

Future Improvements

Searchable Dropdowns: Replace standard <select> with Choices.js or Tom Select for better UX.

Unit Icons: Add icons for each unit type (e.g., 🌡, 📏, ⚖️, 🧪).

Conversion History: Keep track of previous conversions.

Dark/Light Mode Switch: Allow users to toggle themes.
